Android AltBeacon Library
==============================

A Xamarin.Android binding of the [AltBeacon Android Beacon Library](https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library). This library allows Android apps to interact with BLE beacons in accordance with the open and interoperable [AltBeacon proximity beacon protocol specification](https://github.com/AltBeacon/spec).

Note: This library uses the Java library version 2.15, and is Android Oreo (8.x) compatible!

## Use

- [Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AndroidAltBeaconLibrary_2_15/)

## Reference Application (might not be compatible with 2.15)

A simple [sample application](https://github.com/chrisriesgo/Android-AltBeacon-Library/tree/master/Samples/Android/AndroidAltBeaconLibrary.Sample) has been included with this repository to demonstrate ranging proximity beacons and a battery-saving background ranging feature.
